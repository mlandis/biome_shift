This folder contains code to plot Figures 2 through 8 from

> Landis, MJ, EJ Edwards, & MJ Donoghue. Modeling phylogenetic biome shifts on a planet with a past. bioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/832527.

Scripts for plotting figures:

- Fig 2 - `fig2_plot_paleobiome_maps.R`
- Fig 3 - `fig3_plot_stationary_freqs_through_time.R`
- Fig 4 - `fig4_plot_simulation_results.R`
- Fig 5 - `fig5_plot_anc_trees.R` (Aug 11 2020: color scheme is temporarily incorrect, and will be fixed with the next RevGadgets update)
- Fig 6 - `fig6_plot_lstt.R`
- Fig 7 - `fig7_plot_root_freqs.R`
- Fig 8 - `fig8_plot_event_epochs.R` (plots may vary slightly, as subroot states are sampled randomly)

In general, plotting scripts will expect to see the 3 biomes, 6 regions, and 8 epochs defined in the main paper. If your analysis uses a different paleobiome configuration, you may need to modify the scripts accordingly. Feel free to contact me if you need help with this.

More flexible plotting tools to come in the future.
